This is a project to aware people how we have done to Earth which results in world climate changes…

There will be one site with nothing special but a `How we’ve done to Earth` button.
Click on the button will automatically shows the web search result within different period of the keyword ‘word climate changes’.
For example  
	1980:  
		page 1 title with url  
		page 2 title with url  
		page 3 title with url  
	1981:  
		page …  
	1982:…  
	…  
	2014:…  
	2015:…  
	2016:…  

What fact will the search results among different period reveal?
They say there will be inevitable effect if we make no change to our life style.
And this project aims to give motivation to the change, before it is too late.
